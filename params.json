{"name":"Libnetfilter cttimeout","tagline":"Mirror of https://git.netfilter.org/libnetfilter_cttimeout","body":"= cttimeout: timeout policy tuning for Netfilter/conntrack =\r\n\r\nThis infrastructure allows you to define fine-grain timeout\r\npolicies per flow. Basically, from user-space, you can create\r\ntimeout policy objects via nfct_timeout_alloc(), set the\r\npolicy attributes, via nfct_timeout_*_attr_set(), and then\r\nbuild the ctnetlink message to communicate this new timeout\r\npolicy to the kernel.\r\n\r\nctnetlink keeps a list of existing policies that are identified\r\nby one name. Timeout policies can be attached to flows via the\r\niptables CT target.\r\n\r\nThis is useful in case you want to reduce the timeout of TCP\r\nEstablished state to 3000 seconds instead of default 432000\r\nseconds for certain flows. The infrastructure allows fine\r\ntuning of all existing protocol trackers and even modifying\r\nthe timeout for several states for one given protocol.\r\n\r\nThis new infrastructure uses libmnl, thus, libnetfilter_conntrack\r\nremains in intermediate state, meaning that it depends on\r\nlibnfnetlink and libmnl. This should not be a problem since\r\nwe'll require this dual support during the transition to the\r\nnew libnetfilter_conntrack API.\r\n\r\nUnder examples/ directory, you can find examples on how to\r\ncreate new timeout policies, delete them and to retrieve the\r\nexisting list of policies.\r\n\r\n1) You can create one dummy timeout policy:\r\nexamples# ./nfct-timeout-add test 2 6\r\n\r\n2) You can retrieve the policy that is known by `test':\r\n\r\nexamples# ./nfct-timeout-get test\r\n.test = {\r\n        .l3proto = 2,\r\n        .l4proto = 6,\r\n        .policy = {\r\n                .SYN_SENT = 100,\r\n                .SYN_RECV = 120,\r\n                .ESTABLISHED = 60,\r\n                .FIN_WAIT = 432000,\r\n                .CLOSE_WAIT = 120,\r\n                .LAST_ACK = 60,\r\n                .TIME_WAIT = 30,\r\n                .CLOSE = 120,\r\n                .SYN_SENT2 = 10,\r\n        },\r\n};\r\n\r\n3) You may want to retrieve all timeout policies:\r\n\r\nexamples# ./nfct-timeout-get\r\n\r\nThe kernel-space part is planned to be available since Linux\r\nkernel >= 3.4.0.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
